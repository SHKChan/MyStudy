# Special Members

- Implicitly defined as member of classes under certain circumstances. There are six

| Member function                                              | typical form for class `C`: |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| [Default constructor](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/#default_constructor) | `C::C();`                   |
| [Destructor](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/#destructor) | `C::~C();`                  |
| [Copy constructor](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/#copy_constructor) | `C::C (const C&);`          |
| [Copy assignment](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/#copy_assignment) | `C& operator= (const C&);`  |
| [Move constructor](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/#move) | `C::C (C&&);`               |
| [Move assignment](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/#move) | `C& operator= (C&&);`       |

- Fortunately, each class can select explicitly which of these members exist with their default definition or which are deleted by using the keywords `default` and `delete`, respectively.

```c++
Rectangle() = default; // use default construtor
Rectangle (const Rectangle& other) = delete; // remove default copy-constructor
```

## Default Constructor

- If a class definition has no constructors, the compiler assumes the class to have an implicitly defined *default constructor*.
- Same for the other five special members.

## Destructor

Responsible for the necessary cleanup needed by a class when its lifetime ends.

## Copy Constructor

- A constructor whose first parameter is of type *reference to the class* itself (possibly `const` qualified).
- Default copy constructor performs a shallow copy.

```c++
MyClass::MyClass (const MyClass&); // copy constructor definition

MyClass::MyClass(const MyClass& x) : a(x.a), b(x.b), c(x.c) {} // default copy constructor that do shallow copy.

MyClass::MyClass (const Example5& x) : ptr(new string(x.content())) {} // do deep copy
```

##  Copy Assignment

- An overload of `operator=` which takes a *value* or *reference* of the class itself as parameter. The return value is generally a reference to `*this` (although this is not required). 

```c++
MyClass foo;
MyClass bar (foo);       // object initialization: copy constructor called
MyClass baz = foo;       // object initialization: copy constructor called
foo = bar;               // object already initialized: copy assignment called

MyClass& operator= (const MyClass&); // copy assignment operator

MyClass& operator= (const Example5& x) 
{
  delete ptr;                      // delete currently pointed string
  ptr = new string (x.content());  // allocate space for new string, and copy
  return *this;
} // do deep copy

MyClass& operator= (const Example5& x) 
{
  *ptr = x.content();
  return *this;
}
```

## Move  Constructor and Assignment

- Unlike copying, the content is actually transferred from one object (the source) to the other (the destination)
- Only happens when the source of the value is an *unnamed object*.
- *Unnamed objects*: Temporary in nature, and thus haven't even been given a name(return values of functions or type-casts).

```c++
MyClass fn();            // function returning a MyClass object
MyClass foo;             // default constructor
MyClass bar = foo;       // copy constructor
MyClass baz = fn();      // move constructor
foo = bar;               // copy assignment
baz = MyClass();         // move assignment 

// take a parameter of type rvalue reference to the class itself
MyClass (MyClass&&);             // move-constructor
MyClass& operator= (MyClass&&);  // move-assignment
// an rvalue reference is specified by following the type with two ampersands (&&)
```

**Copying** and **Moving** for new and delete Object:

- Copying from A to B means that new memory is allocated to B and then the entire content of A is copied to this **new memory allocated** for B.
- Moving from A to B means that the memory already allocated to A is transferred to B without allocating any new storage. It involves simply **copying the pointer**.
