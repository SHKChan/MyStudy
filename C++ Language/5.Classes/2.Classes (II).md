# Classes (II)

## Overloading Operators

```c++
// Overloading with operator functions, member functions
CVector operator + (const CVector&);
CVector a, b, c;
c = a + b;
c = a.operator+(b);

// As non-member functions
CVector operator+ (const CVector& lhs, const CVector& rhs)
```

- Different operators than can be overloaded (please, replace `@` by the operator in each case):

  | Expression  | Operator                                        | Member function         | Non-member function |
  | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
  | `@a`        | `+ - * & ! ~ ++ --`                             | `A::operator@()`        | `operator@(A)`      |
  | `a@`        | `++ --`                                         | `A::operator@(int)`     | `operator@(A,int)`  |
  | `a@b`       | `+ - * / % ^ & | < > == != <= >= << >> && || ,` | `A::operator@(B)`       | `operator@(A,B)`    |
  | `a@b`       | `= += -= *= /= %= ^= &= |= <<= >>= []`          | `A::operator@(B)`       | -                   |
  | `a(b,c...)` | `()`                                            | `A::operator()(B,C...)` | -                   |
  | `a->b`      | `->`                                            | `A::operator->()`       | -                   |
  | `(TYPE) a`  | `TYPE`                                          | `A::operator TYPE()`    | -                   |

## The Keyword this

  Represents a pointer to the object whose member function is being executed.

## Static Members

  - Known as a "class variable", because there is only one common variable for all the objects of that same class, sharing the same value.

  - Same properties as non-member variables but enjoy class scope. To avoid be declared several times, need to be initialized outside class.

    ```c++
    int Dummy::n = 0;
    ```
  
  - Classes can also have static member functions. Cannot access non-static members. They neither can use the keyword `this`.

## Const Member Functions

```
const MyClass myObject;

int get() const {return x;}        // const member function
const int& get() {return x;}       // member function returning a const&
const int& get() const {return x;} // const member function returning a const& 

// const members shall not modify the state of an object. Limited to access only member functions marked as const
```

- Data members from outside the class is restricted to read-only.
- Member functions of a `const` object can only be called if they are themselves specified as `const` members.
- Member functions can be overloaded on their constness.

## Class Templates

```c++
template <type T>
class mypair {
    T values [2];
  public:
    mypair (T first, T second)
    {
      values[0]=first; values[1]=second;
    }
};

mypair<int> myobject (115, 36);
mypair<double> myfloats (3.0, 2.18);
```

### Template Specialization

Define a different implementation for a template when a specific type is passed as template argument.

```c++
// template specialization
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// class template:
template <class T>
class mycontainer 
{
    T element;
  public:
    mycontainer (T arg) {element=arg;}
    T increase () {return ++element;}
};

// class template specialization:
// more convenient to have a completely different implementation for char type

// must also define all its members, no "inheritance" of members from the generic template to the specialization.
template <>
class mycontainer <char> 
{
    char element;
  public:
    mycontainer (char arg) {element=arg;}
    char uppercase ()
    {
      if ((element>='a')&&(element<='z'))
      element+='A'-'a';
      return element;
    }
};

int main () 
{
  mycontainer<int> myint (7);
  mycontainer<char> mychar ('j');
  cout << myint.increase() << endl;
  cout << mychar.uppercase() << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
