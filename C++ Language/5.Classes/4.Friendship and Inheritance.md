# Friendship and Inheritance

## Friend Functions

- A non-member function can access the private and protected members of a class if it is declared a *friend* of that class.
- Typically conducted between two different classes accessing private or protected members of both.

```C++
friend Rectangle duplicate (const Rectangle&); // including a declaration of this external function within the class with keyword friend
```

## Friend Classes

- A class whose members have access to the private or protected members of another class.
- Never corresponded.
- Not transitive.

```c++
// class Rectangle is a friend of class Square allowing Rectangle's member functions to access private and protected members of Square.
// but Square is not considered a friend by Rectangle.
class Square; // empty declaration
class Rectangle 
{
    ...
    void convert (Square a);
}


class Square 
{
	friend class Rectangle;
	...
 }
```

## Inheritance between classes

- The *derived class* inherits the members of the *base class*, on top of which it can add its own members.

- The derived class can access the **protected** members but not **private** members.

  | Access                    | `public` | `protected` | `private` |
  | ------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------- |
  | members of the same class | yes      | yes         | yes       |
  | members of derived class  | yes      | yes         | no        |
  | not members               | yes      | no          | no        |

  

```c++
class Polygon { ... };
class Rectangle: public Polygon { ... };
class Triangle: public Polygon { ... };
```

## What is Inherited from the Base Class?

every member of a base class except:

- its **constructors** and its **destructor**
- its **assignment operator members** (operator=)
- its **friends**
- its **private** members

## Multiple Inheritance

```c++
class Rectangle: public Polygon, public Output;
class Triangle: public Polygon, public Output;
```
