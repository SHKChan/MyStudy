# Classes (I)

- An expanded concept of *data structures*, which can contain data members and functions members.

- Object: An instantiation of a class. Class is data type while Object is a variable.
- By default, all members of a class declared with the `class` keyword have **private** access for all its members.

```c++
class class_name 
{
  access_specifier_1: member1;
  access_specifier_2: member2;
  ...
} object_names;
```

## Constructors

Automatically called whenever a new object of this class is created, allowing the class to initialize member variables or allocate storage.

```c++
// Four ways to construct objects of a class
Circle foo (10.0);   // functional form
Circle bar = 20.0;   // assignment init.
Circle baz {30.0};   // uniform init.
Circle qux = {40.0}; // POD-like

// Member initialization in constructors
Rectangle::Rectangle (int x, int y) : width(x), height(y) 
{ 
}
// For member objects (those whose type is a class), if they are not initialized after the colon, they are default-constructed.
```

## Classes Define with Struct and Union

- Default access in `class`classes  is`private`.
- Default access in `struct`classes  is `public`.
- Default access in `union` classes is `public`.
