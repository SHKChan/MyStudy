# Polymorphism

## Pointers to Base Class

A pointer to a derived class is type-compatible with a pointer to its base class. But only the members inherited from base class can be accessed in this situation.

## Virtual Members

- A member function that can be redefined in a derived class to implement **polymorphism** when using base class pointing to derive class.
- Despite of the virtuality of one of its members, base class still a regular class.

```
virtual int area () { return 0; } // virtual function
```

## Abstract Base Classes

- Have virtual member functions without definition.
- Can only be used as base classes, not a regular class, called abstract class.

```
virtual int area () =0; // pure virtual function
```
