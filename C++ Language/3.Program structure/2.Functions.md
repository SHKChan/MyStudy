# Functions

A group of statement that is given a name.

## The Return Value of main

The compiler assumes the main function ends with an implicit return statement.

```c++
return 0;
```

## Arguments Passed by Value and by Reference

```c++
// passed by value
void fun1 (int a);

// passed by reference
void fun2 (int& a);
```

## Efficiency Considerations and Const References

Arguments by reference do not require a copy.

To guarantee that its reference parameters are not going to be modified by qualifying the parameters as constant

```c++
// forbidden to modify the values of neither a nor b within fun1
string fun1 (const string&a const string& b) 
{
	return a+b;
}
```

## Inline Functions

Calling a function causes a certain overhead, and thus for short function. it is more efficient to insert the code where it is called.

```c++
inline string fun1 (const string&a const string& b)
{
	return a+b;
}
```

## Default Value in Parameters

## Declaring Functions

The prototype of a function can be declared without defining it.

```c++
int fun1 (int, int);
```

## Recursivity

The property that functions have to be called by themselves.
