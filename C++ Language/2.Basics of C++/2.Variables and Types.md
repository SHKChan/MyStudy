# Variables and Types

## Variable

A portion of memory to store a value.

## Identifiers

Valid identifier: Consists of letters(case sensitive), digits or underscore characters(_) and should begin with a letter or an underscore characters.

## Fundamental Data Types

Different data types occupy different amount of memory.

- **Character types**: 'char', one-byte(eight-bit)

- **Numerical integer types**: can be signed or unsinged

- **Floating-point types**: different levels of precision

- **Boolean type**: only represent one of two states, true or false

- **Void type**: void

- **Null pointer**: decltype(nullptr)

  See <limits> to check fundamental types in a particular condition.

## Declaration of  Variables

Informs the complier the size to reserve in memory for the variable and how to interpret its value.

 ## Type Deduction: auto and decltype

Decide type on initialization.

```cpp
int foo = 0;
auto foo1 = 1;
decltype(foo) foo2;
```

## Introduction to strings

An example of compound type, able to store sequence of characters.

```cpp
#include <string>

string myString = "This is a string."
```
