# Input/output with Files

Classes to perform output and input of characters to/from files:

- **`ofstream`:** Stream class to write on files
- **`ifstream`:** Stream class to read from files
- **`fstream`:** Stream class to both read and write from/to files.

Use our file streams the same way we are already used to use `cin` and `cout`.

```c++
// basic file operations
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  ofstream myfile;
  myfile.open ("example.txt");
  myfile << "Writing this to a file.\n";
  myfile.close();
  return 0;
}
```

## Open a File

```c++
myFile.open(filename, mode);

if (myfile.is_open()) { /* ok, proceed with output */ }
```

## Closing a File

```
myFile.close();
```

## Text Files

```c++
// writing on a text file
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  ofstream myfile ("example.txt");
  if (myfile.is_open())
  {
    myfile << "This is a line.\n";
    myfile << "This is another line.\n";
    myfile.close();
  }
  else cout << "Unable to open file";
  return 0;
}
```

```c++
// reading a text file
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  string line;
  ifstream myfile ("example.txt");
  if (myfile.is_open())
  {
    while ( getline (myfile,line) )
    {
      cout << line << '\n';
    }
    myfile.close();
  }

  else cout << "Unable to open file"; 

  return 0;
}
```

## Checking State Flags

Check for specific states of a stream

- bad(): Returns `true` if a reading or writing operation fails.
- fail(): Returns `true` in the same cases as `bad()`, but also in the case that a format error happens.
- eof(): Returns `true` if a file open for reading has reached the end.
- good(): It returns `false` in the same cases in which calling any of the previous functions would return `true`.
- clear(): Reset the state flags.

## Get and Put Stream Positioning

Can be observed and modified using the following member functions(position count in byte):

```
tellg() and tellp() // return current get and put position
seekg() and seekp() // change get and put position

```

## Binary Files

Two member functions specifically designed to read and write binary data sequentially:

```
// memory_block is of type char* (pointer to char)
write ( memory_block, size );
read ( memory_block, size );
```

## Buffers and Synchronization

- **Buffer**: Represent a memory block that acts as an intermediary between the stream and the physical file.

- **Synchronization**: When the buffer is flushed, all the data contained in it is written to the physical medium.
