# Dynamic Memory

Memory needs of a program can only be determined during runtime. Programs need to dynamically allocate memory, for which the C++ language integrates the operators `new` and `delete`.

## Operator new and delete

- Differences between array and new [] : constant size and variable value as size.
- Dynamic memory is allocated by the system from the memory heap.

```c++
pointer = new type
pointer = new type [number_of_elements]
    
foo = new (nothrow) int [5]; // allocation is failed, new return null pointer instead of exception for new (nothrow).
```

- Dynamic memory need to be freed manually with delete.
- In the case of a *null pointer*, `delete` produces no effect

```c++
delete pointer;
delete[] pointer;
```

## Dynamic Memory in C

For dynamic memory allocation, C used a library solution, with the functions `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `free`, defined in the header `<cstdlib>` (known as `<stdlib.h>` in C).
