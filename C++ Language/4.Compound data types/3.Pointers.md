# Pointers

- Memory in C++ program: A succession of single-byte memory cells with unique address.

- Pointer: A variable which stores the address of another variable.

## Address-of Operator(&) and Dereference Operator(*)

- `&`: The *address-of operator*, and can be read simply as "address of"

- `*`: The *dereference operator*, and can be read as "value pointed to by"

- All pointers occupy the same amount of space in memory(size depends on running platform).

  ```c++
  int * myPointer1, * myPointer2; // declare pointer
  int x = 10;
  myPointer1 = &x; // set pointer values as the address of x
  myPointer2 = myPointer1; // set pointer values as the address of x
  *myPointer2 = 20; // set value pointed by pointer to be 20
  ```

  

## Pointers and Arrays

- Array name is actually a pointer  to its first element.. 
- Difference: Pointers can be assigned new addresses, while arrays cannot.

```c++
int numbers[5];
int * p;
p = numbers;  *p = 10; // numbers[0]
p++;  *p = 20; // numbers[1]
p = &numbers[2];  *p = 30; // numbers[2]
p = numbers + 3;  *p = 40; // numbers[3]
p = numbers;  *(p+4) = 50; // numbers[4]
for (int n=0; n<5; n++)
	cout << numbers[n] << ", "; // would print 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
 
a[5] = 0;       // a [offset of 5] = 0, '[]' is offset operator
*(a+5) = 0;     // pointed to by (a+5) = 0 
```

## Pointer Initialization, Arithmetics and string literal

```c++
int myvar;
int * myptr = &myvar; // initialiation

// only addition and subtraction operations works on pointers
// Behavior of addition and subtraction operation on pointers have a slightly different base on its data type

char *mychar = 1000;
short *myshort = 2000;
long *mylong = 3000;
// pointing to the following element of the same type, add the size in bytes of the type
++mychar; // 1001
++myshort; // 2002
++mylong; // 30004

//four possible combinations of the dereference operator with both the prefix and suffix versions of the increment operator
*p++   // same as *(p++): increment pointer, and dereference unincremented address
*++p   // same as *(++p): increment pointer, and dereference incremented address
++*p   // same as ++(*p): dereference pointer, and increment the value it points to
(*p)++ // dereference pointer, and post-increment the value it points to 
    
const char * foo = "Hello"; // declares an array without identifier for "hello", and then a pointer to its first element
*(foo+4) // equal to foo[4], 'o'
```

## Pointers to Pointers, Void Pointers, Invalid Pointers and null Pointers

```c++
// Pointers to Pointers
char a;
char *b;
char **c;
a = 'z';
b = &a;
c = &b;

// Void Pointers
// In C++, void represents the absence of type.
// Void pointers: pointers that point to a value that has no type(thus also an undetermined length). A great flexibility, by being able to point to any data type.
void increase (void* data, int psize)
{
    // void pointers cannot be directly dereferenced
    // sizeof return size in bytes of its argument
  if ( psize == sizeof(char) ) 
  { 
      char* pchar = (char*)data; 
      ++(*pchar); 
  }
  else if (psize == sizeof(int) )
  { 
      int* pint = (int*)data ; 
      ++(*pint); 
  }
}

// Invalid Pointers and null Pointers
int * p = 0; // point to nowhere, pointing to invalid element.
int * q = nullptr;
int * r = NULL; // in standard library # define NULL = nullptr/0
```

## Pointers to Functions

```c++
int subtraction (int a, int b)
{ 
	return (a-b); 
}

int m,n;
int (*minus)(int,int) = subtraction; // pointer name minus, pointing to function called subtraction(int, int)
```
