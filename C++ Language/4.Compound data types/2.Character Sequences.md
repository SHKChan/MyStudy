# Character Sequences

Null character('0') : In order to indicate the end of sequence.

## Initialization of null-terminated Character Sequences

```c++
char foo[] = { 'H', 'I', '\0' };

char fool[] = "HI";
```

- Literal constants: Sequence of character enclosed in double-quotes(").  A null character (`'\0'`) automatically appended at the end of literal constants.
- Arrays cannot be assigned values.

## String and null-terminated Character Sequences

- C-string : Plain arrays with null-terminated sequences of characters.
- Library string: Class string within header <string>.
- Differences: size of arrays is determined on compilation, while strings have a dynamic size determined during runtime.

```c++
char myntcs[] = "some text";
string mystring = myntcs;  // convert c-string to string
cout << mystring;          // printed as a library string
cout << mystring.c_str();  // printed as a c-string
```
