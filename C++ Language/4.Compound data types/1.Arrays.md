## Arrays

A series of elements of the same ty[e placed in contiguous memory locations.

## Example

```c++
// Arrays are blocks of static memory whose size must be determined at compile time, before the program runs. [] must be a constant expression.
int foo[5];

# define LENGTH 4;
int foo[LENGTH];

// Initialiazing arrays
int foo[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3 ,4}; //  If declared with less, the remaining elements are set to their default values(0 for fundamental types).
int foo[] = {0, 1, 2, 3 ,4};

int foo[]{0, 1, 2, 3 ,4}; // universal initialization
```

## Multidimensional Arrays

```c++
int foo[2][2];
```

## Arrays as Parameters

What is really passed is a pointer.

```c++
void fun (int arr[], int length);

void fun(int arr[][3][4]); // for multidimensional array
```

## Library Arrays

Since built-in arrays restricting copy and easily decay into pointer, an alternative array type  is provided as a standard container within header <array>.

```
# include <array>
array <int, 3> arr{0, 1, 2}
```
