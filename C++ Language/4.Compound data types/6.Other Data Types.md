## Other Data Types

## Type Aliases(typedef / using)

- by using an alias of `int`, it allows for the type to be easily replaced by `long` in a later version, without having to change every instance where it is used.

```c++
// typedef, inherit from C language
typedef char C; // for char
typedef unsigned int WORD; for unsigned int
typedef char * pChar; for char *
typedef char field [50]; for char[50]
    
// using, C++ style
using C = char;
using WORD = unsigned int;
using pChar = char *;
using field = char [50];
```

## Unions

Allow **one portion of memory** to be accessed as different data types.

- Share the same memory
- Can only be one of the data type it defines.

```c++
union mix_t 
{
  int l;
  struct 
  {
    short hi;
    short lo;
   } s;
  char c[4];
} mix;

// Allows the access to the same group of 4 bytes: mix.l, mix.s and mix.c, and which we can use according to how we want to access these bytes

//Anonymous Unions,  when unions are members of a class (or structure)
struct book2_t 
{
  char title[50];
  char author[50];

  union 
  {
    float dollars;
    int yen;
  };

} book2;

// access to anonymous union
book2.dollars = ...;
book2.yen = ...;
```

### Enumerated types (enum)

Values of *enumerated types* declared with `enum` are implicitly convertible to an integer type(0, 1, 2, ...).

```c++
enum months_t 
{ 
    january=1, 
    february, 
    march, 
    april,
    may, 
    june, 
    july, 
    august,
    september, 
    october, 
    november, 
    december
};
```

### Enumerated types with enum class

Neither implicitly convertible to `int` and that neither have enumerator values of type `int`,  thus preserving type safety.

```c++
enum class Colors [: char]
{
    black, 
    blue, 
    green, 
    cyan, 
    red, 
    purple, 
    yellow, 
    white
};
```
