## Data Structures

A data structure is a group of data elements grouped together under one name.

## Example

```c++
struct product 
{
  int weight;
  double price;
} ;

product apple;
product banana, melon
```

## Pointers to Structures

```c++
product *p = &apple;
p->weight = ...; // arrow operator (->), a dereference operator for structure pointer.
p->price = ...;
```

## Nesting Structures

Structures can also be nested
